## Features
- Set up in _literally_ 2 minutes.
  - you just need an [OpenAPI spec](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) (which can be automatically generated if you don't already have one).
- Browse & query your API in a Human-friendly way.
  - HopFront understands relationships between your endpoints, no more copy/pasting your ids everywhere!
- Build custom and dynamic dashboards.
  - Useful for rapidly building internal tools or personalized UIs based on your daily API interactions.
